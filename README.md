🚀 Multi-AI Agent Systems with CrewAI

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to my learning journey through the Multi-AI Agent Systems with CrewAI course by DeepLearning.AI. The course explores how to design, build, and deploy AI agent systems that collaborate efficiently.

📚 Course Overview

This course covers:

The fundamentals of Multi-AI Agent Systems

Designing autonomous AI agents

Implementing CrewAI for multi-agent coordination

Hands-on assignments to reinforce concepts


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

CrewAI for multi-agent collaboration

Python for scripting and implementation

LangChain for AI-powered workflows

OpenAI APIs for language-based tasks

🚧 Work in Progress

I'm actively working on completing the assignments and projects, experimenting with different agent architectures, and refining my understanding of CrewAI.

📌 Stay Tuned!

I'll be updating this repository regularly with new learnings, completed assignments, and insights from the course. If you're also exploring multi-agent systems, feel free to connect!
